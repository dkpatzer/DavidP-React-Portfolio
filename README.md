# DP-React-Portfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio of my work as a web developer. It is built using React. It is a single page application that uses React Router to navigate between pages. It is deployed on GitHub Pages, is responsive and works on mobile devices. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling. It uses Craco for bootstrapping the React application with a pre-configured development environment.

Building this app allowed me to work with react and by doing so, understanding its set up and functioning better. I learned how to work with tailwind and craco. I learned how to deploy a react app to GitHub pages. I learned how to use react router to navigate between pages. I learned how to use react components to build a single page application. I learned how to use react to build a responsive and mobile first application.I learned how to use Google Maps and embed it in my portfolio.

## Installation
I began by iinitializing the app and installing necessary dependencies. I t created the components for the header, footer, about me, portfolio, contact me and resume.  I then created the routes for the pages. I then created the links for the header and footer. I created the form for the contact me page. I created the map for the contact me page. I then created the links for the portfolio page. I then created the links for the resume page. I then created the links for the footer. I then created the links for the header. I made screenshots of previous apps and pust them into an images folder in the public folder. I also added a personal photograph. I tested the Portfolio multiple times using local host and then deployed it to GitHub pages.
